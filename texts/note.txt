LEGEND:
T - Thine birthplace, lovely little town you're living in. As time passes, almost nothing changes around here, and gopher folk carry on with their peaceful and quiet living behind high and sturdy walls of centenary oak.
Q - Town's main gate. Only through it you can access the city.
~ - Waterlogged areas. Though you can't swim, you'll have to find a good old ferry that can deliver you to the other side.
- - Marshes, mires, bogs and e.g. It's hard to move around here in heavy armor.	
@ - Good ol' trusty ferry. It can deliver you to the other side of the river.
F - Millenia Forests. They had been there since the dawn of the gopher folk. Even the elders of the town can't remember the world without them.
^ - Feet of the High Mountains. Though they are not as high and dangerous as High Mountains themselves, it is still chilly in this region. Such a weak creature as the gopher can't withstand this cold in a light armor.
/\ - High Mountains themselves. Since the beginning of our sentient existance, we tried to broaden our knowledge of the surrounding world, and theese mountains on the west became an insurmountable obstacle for our travellers and adventurers. Strong winds and decieving thin paths do not show mercy for the weak and poor-prepaired ones. You can't go there.
# - Vast Fields of the West. This is where your people take place from, where the first percieved glance of the gopher fell upon the surrounding world. Though in time your kin decided to move closer to the forests, they can not forget where did they come from.  
: - The Great Sands. Hot and stuffy place. This desert stretches far to the north-west, to the uncharted lands, where the dragons are. Only the boldest of the gophers dared to explore this place. Due to the the unstable ground and suffocating atmosphere, it would be hard to cross it in heavy armour.
W - According to the rumors, there are Wild Wolves in this area. You can search for them here.
S - According to the rumors, there are Slimes in this area. You can search for them here.
G - According to the rumors, there are Grifones in this area. You can search for them here.
C - According to the rumors, there are Cave Trolls in this area. You can search for them here.
L - According to the rumors, there are Fire Lizards in this area. You can search for them here.

FOR THE DEV:

Относительно областей с монстрами: в начале каждого дня монстр(если они остались в этом районе) появляется в рандомном поле соответствующего ареала. чтобы баттлится с монстром игрок может либо просто прочесать наугад весь ареал, либо применить интеллект, чтобы игра подсказала ему направление и/или расстояние до клетки, в которой заспаунился мостр. Подробнее ниже

Игрок начинает в локации "Q", откуда начинается его путешествие. Далее он свободно двигается по карте в направлениях вверх, вниз, вправо, влево. За перемещение по клетке снимается определенное кол-во усталости(всего 100 + лагерные принадлежности). За перемещение по:
- ^, C - 2, if in heavy armour(at least 5 elements); else 4
- T - can not walk on 
- F - 2
- #, G - 1
- -, S - 2, if in light armour(at least 5 elements); else 4
- ~ - can not walk on
- /\ - can not walk on
- :, L - 2, if in light armour(at least 5 elements); else 4
- @ - 0
- Q - 0
Если во время путешествия усталость падает до 0, суслик падает в обморок, т.е. просыпается на следующий день с 80 усталости и дебаффом ко всем базовым характеристикам(пока что поставь какой хочешь, отбалансим позже). Дебафф снимается когда суслик добирается до норы и спит там.

Когда игрок находится на определенной клетке, ему предоставляется определенный набор действий:
- F - look aroud(описание тайла. одна из нескольких фраз.), show legend(показать легенду карты), move right, up, down, left
- Q - look aroud, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- - - look aroud, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- @ - look aroud, cross the river(пересечь реку, не тратит усталости), show legend, move right, up, down, left
- ^ - look aroud, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- # - look aroud, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- : - look aroud, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- W - look aroud, search(попытка понять, где могут быть монстры. Бросок d20 + int, если больше 18 - удается определить направление и расстояние до места, где волки. если от 14 до 18 - удается определить направление, где волки. меньше - ничего не удается узнать. За день в каждом квадрате можно искать лишь раз. Если игрок находится в квадрате с монстром, есму по любому покажется сообщение: "you can see a %monstername% nearby"), fight(если монстр на этом тайле), show legend, move right, up, down, left
- S - look aroud, search, fight, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- G - look aroud, search, fight, show legend, move right, up, down, left 
- C - look aroud, search, fight, show legend, move right, up, down, left
- L - look aroud, search, fight, show legend, move right, up, down, left

Q - "You exit the maingate and take a deep breath. The air is fresh, the weather is exellent. After regulating some straps, you are ready to go."
  - "You thow a glance at your dear home. The wave of nostalgic memories hits you, making question the purpose of the travel. You shake your head, driving the bad things away. The whole world stands still, waiting"
  - "The exit gate Lies behind you. Adventures are in front of you. You take your first step..."
  - "A short prayer flies out of your mouth. For the home you are leaving behind, for the unknown, you sre yet to dare."

- - "Only God himself knows what have these swamps prepaired for you. The sooner you get out of here, the better."

  - "Ha! The poor fool still stands, battered and broken as his precious ferry."
  - "The sparkling eyes of youth have faded in this boatman. Nowadays, his only anchor to reality is the old batterd ferry he treasures so much."

F - "These forests stand stil since the beginning of the times. High. Ancient. The silent sentinels of the wilderness."
  - "You take a prolonged, deep breath, filling longues with the forest's smells. Slightly sweet odor of rotting, bitter and harsh smell of tree's resin. These stalwart giants do not oppress you anymore. Your way is lit and your path is clear, now you require only the strength to follow it."
  - "You start to find the noises of the forest surprisingly calming. The crunch of the fallen leafs and soft rustle of the grass brings peace to your little heart. A peace so deep... it is like... The Dark..."
  - "How funny of your kind was to seek shelter by this Forest. It may seem safe from the outside, but the're are unspeakable horrors in the most tenebrous corners of this place. You feel, that this forest belongs to them. You can feel, that your presence is only tolerated while you do not disturb the old-settled state of this ancient dominion."

^ - "From around here you can see the peaks of the High Mountains. Chill runs down on your spine from a single thought of being up there, in this cold and non-forgiving place."
  - "An enormous ridge is laying in front of your eyes, daring towards the skies above. Nothing feels real in comprasion with this manifestation of the primal force of nature."
  - "One can never get used to the cold, and you've experienced it on your own fur. Slumped shoulders, wild eyes, and a stumbling gait - you carry on with your journey."
