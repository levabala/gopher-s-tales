DESCRIPTIONS = {
    'T': '''
    Thine birthplace, lovely little town you're living in. 
    As time passes, almost nothing changes around here, and gopher folk carry on 
    with their peaceful and quiet living behind high and sturdy walls of centenary oak.
    ''',

    'Q': '''
    Town's main gate. Only through it you can access the city.
    ''',

    '~': '''
    Waterlogged areas. 
    Though you can't swim, you'll have to find a good old ferry 
    that can deliver you to the other side.
    ''',

    '-': '''
    Marshes, mires, bogs and e.g. It's hard to move around here in heavy armor.
    ''',

    '^': '''
    Feet of the High Mountains. 
    Though they are not as high and dangerous as High Mountains themselves, 
    it is still chilly in this region. 
    Such a weak creature as the gopher can't withstand this cold in a light armor.
    ''',

    '/\\': '''
    High Mountains themselves. Since the beginning of our sentient existance, 
    we tried to broaden our knowledge of the surrounding world, 
    and theese mountains on the west became an insurmountable obstacle 
    for our travellers and adventurers. 
    Strong winds and decieving thin paths do not show mercy for the weak 
    and poor-prepaired ones. You can't go there.
    ''',

    '#': '''
    Vast Fields of the West. 
    This is where your people take place from, 
    where the first percieved glance of the gopher fell upon the surrounding world. 
    Though in time your kin decided to move closer to the forests, 
    they can not forget where did they come from.  
    ''',

    ':': '''
    The Great Sands. 
    Hot and stuffy place. This desert stretches far to the north-west, 
    to the uncharted lands, where the dragons are. 
    Only the boldest of the gophers dared to explore this place. 
    Due to the the unstable ground and suffocating atmosphere, 
    it would be hard to cross it in heavy armour.
